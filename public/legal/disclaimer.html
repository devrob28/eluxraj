      <strong>⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE:</strong> Investing involves substantial risk. You can lose some or all of your invested capital. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Before investing, carefully consider your financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. This disclaimer contains important information about the risks associated with alternative investments.

    <div class="legal-section">
      <h2>1. General Investment Risk Disclosure</h2>
      
      <h3>1.1 All Investments Carry Risk</h3>
      <p>ALL INVESTMENTS INVOLVE RISK, INCLUDING THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL. The value of your investments may fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives or avoid losses.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Past Performance</h3>
      <p>PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Historical returns, whether actual or hypothetical, do not guarantee similar future performance. Market conditions, economic factors, and regulatory changes can significantly impact investment outcomes.</p>

      <h3>1.3 No Guarantees</h3>
      <p>We make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any investment recommendations, signals, or information provided through our Platform. Investment decisions are your sole responsibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="legal-section">
      <h2>2. Alternative Asset-Specific Risks</h2>
      
      <h3>2.1 Illiquidity Risk</h3>
      <p>Alternative assets (precious metals, collectibles, art, private equity, real estate) are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities. You may not be able to sell these assets quickly or at desired prices. Market conditions, lack of buyers, and transaction costs can significantly impact your ability to exit positions.</p>

      <h3>2.2 Valuation Uncertainty</h3>
      <p>Alternative assets often lack transparent, real-time pricing. Valuations may be subjective, infrequent, or based on limited market data. Appraisals can vary significantly between experts. The true market value may only be known when an asset is actually sold.</p>

      <h3>2.3 Market Volatility</h3>
      <p>Alternative asset markets can experience extreme volatility. Prices may fluctuate dramatically due to supply/demand imbalances, economic conditions, geopolitical events, regulatory changes, or shifts in investor sentiment.</p>

      <h3>2.4 Concentration Risk</h3>
      <p>Alternative assets may represent significant concentrations of wealth in single items or asset classes. Lack of diversification increases the impact of adverse events affecting specific holdings.</p>

      <h3>2.5 Fraud & Authenticity Risk</h3>
      <p>The alternative asset market has risk of fraud, counterfeiting, and misrepresentation. Authentication, provenance verification, and condition assessment require expert knowledge. We cannot guarantee the authenticity or quality of any assets.</p>

      <h3>2.6 Storage & Insurance Costs</h3>
      <p>Physical assets require secure storage, insurance, and maintenance. These costs can be substantial and reduce overall returns. Loss, theft, or damage may not be fully covered by insurance.</p>

      <h3>2.7 Regulatory & Tax Risk</h3>
      <p>Alternative assets may be subject to complex regulatory requirements and tax treatment. Rules vary by jurisdiction and asset type. Changes in laws or regulations can adversely affect asset values and liquidity.</p>

      <h3>2.8 Transaction Costs</h3>
      <p>Buying and selling alternative assets typically involves significant transaction costs including dealer spreads, auction fees, appraisal costs, shipping, and insurance. These costs can substantially reduce returns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="legal-section">
      <h2>3. AI-Generated Signals & Recommendations</h2>

        <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> Models may identify patterns that don't persist in real markets</li>
        <li><strong>Market Regime Changes:</strong> Models may fail when market dynamics shift</li>
      </ul>
